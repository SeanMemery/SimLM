Very importantly, when viewing the table from top down a value of PHI=0 will hit cue ball to the east, i.e. in the positive x direction. Then, PHI=90 is north (positive y), PHI=180 is west (negative x), and PHI=270 is south (negative y).\n2. The (X,Z) value controls the amount of ENGLISH applied to the cue ball, a value of (0,0) and low THETA would strike the cue ball at its centre with a near level stick, making for a smooth ball motion with little to no spin. But, a negative z (or high THETA) will impart a back spin, and the opposite will impart a top spin, which have their own benefits.\n3. Hitting a ball at an angle has the most impact on the path of the ball following collision.\nThere are also certain rules you MUST follow when taking a shot in pool:\n- Make sure the cue ball does not fall into a pocket\n- Make sure the cue ball collides with a ball\nYou will be penalized for breaking these rules.\nThese are the coordinates of each pocket on the table:\nPocket lb (Left Back): (0.00, 0.00)\nPocket lc (Left Centre): (0.00, 1.00)\nPocket lt (Left Top): (0.00, 2.00)\nPocket rb (Right Back): (1.00, 0.00)\nPocket rc (Right Centre): (1.00, 1.00)\nPocket rt (Right Top): (1.00, 2.00)\nNow, the current state of the board (i.e. the position of each ball) is given below:\n{{ board_state }}\n{% if examples %}\nBelow are a series of examples of similar tasks carried out on similar boards.
