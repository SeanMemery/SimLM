What height and horizontal velocity values should you use? \nBe VERY careful when deciding if a bounce position is within 1m of the target, for a target of 12m the third bounce must occur between 11m and 13m in order to be 1m from 12m. \nGive your reasoning for the task in a single paragraph.\nREASONING:\nThere's not much information to go off of here, so I'll need to make some assumptions. If the ball starts off at a height 'h' and moves at a horizontal velocity of 'v', then in the time it takes for the ball to fall to the ground 't1' it will have travelled t1*v meters.Then, the ball will lose speed due to the collision with the ground, lets say 20%, so the ball will then travel at 0.8*v meters per second.The time it takes to reach the ground is t1 = sqrt(2 * h / g), for the constant of gravity 'g' I'll use 9.81 m/s^2.Now we assume that the ball reaches a height ~70% of the original height, so h2 = 0.7 * h.Then the time to rise and fall is t2 = h2 / g + sqrt(2 * h2 / g), the 2nd bounce is t1*v + t2*0.8*v.So, this occurs again for the 3rd bounce, t3 = sqrt(2 * h3 / g) + h3 / g, where h3 = 0.7 * h2.Then finally the total distance travelled is t1*v + t2*0.8*v + t3*0.8*0.8*v.Let's make a guess that 'v' is 10m/s, then the total distance travelled is 10*t1 + 8*t2 + 6.4*t3.Then, let's try make the total distance travelled 12m, so 10*t1 + 8*t2 + 6.4*t3 = 12.A 'h' value of 2m gives t1 = sqrt(4/g) = ~0.64s, t2 = 0.7*2/g + sqrt(2*0.7*2/g) = ~0.65s, t3 = 0.7*0.7*2/g + sqrt(2*0.7*0.7*2/g) = ~0.5s.Then, 10*0.64 + 8*0.65 + 6.4*0.5 = 14.8m, which is a good start at getting close to 12m.Therefore, the height and horizontal velocity values should be:\n{\n    \"height\": 2.0,\n    \"horizontal_velocity\": 10.0,\n}\nSIMULATION:\nAfter running the simulation, the three bounces occurred at:\nBounce 1: 6.39m, Bounce 2: 13.04m, Bounce 3: 18.32m\nGive a critique of the reasoning and simulation results, in a single paragraph.\nCRITIQUE:\nClearly the initial conditions we came to were too high, as the third bounce occured at 18.32m, which is 6.32m more than 12m and 6.32>1.
